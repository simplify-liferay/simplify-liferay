# Simplify Liferay

## About us
We're a group created to facilitate the life of Liferay developers, with repositories that help people understand complex concepts, or by serving as a cheatsheet for daily tasks. Our goal is to create a safe point for Liferay community and increase people's interest in this awesome tool. We intend to do this by explaining and implementing from Liferay's most complex concepts to the simplest, in an easy way to understand but with no superficial explanations.

We know that Liferay's documentation isn't the best, but that should not diminish the fact that it's a great technology in constant development.

## How this works
Each repository consists of a module implementing some Liferay functionality or showing some concept, with a detailed README explaining each part of it.
